# Helping Hive

Helping Hive is a centralized platform designed to connect volunteers with NGOs and other related organizations, addressing the challenge of scattered volunteering opportunities. This platform not only makes it easier for individuals to find relevant volunteering opportunities but also keeps them engaged through gamified features like badges and streaks.
